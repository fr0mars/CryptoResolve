# CryptoResolve (Currently in Development)

## CryptoResolve is a tool to secure the use of well-known cryptosystems and key exchange methods (RSA, ECC, ## DHKE...) by identifying possible attacks on the parameters that you are using.


# Available Attacks
  ## RSA
  ### - Fermat factorization attack on the Modulus (09/23)
  ### - Wiener attack on small private keys (09/23)

  ## Diffie-Hellman
  ### - Bruteforce on small keys with Baby Step Giant Step algorithm. (09/23)

# Incoming ...
  ### - Support for message decryption (12/23)
  ### - Attack on multiple message with low exponent (CRT) (12/23)
